# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).







## [2.4.2] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Improve shoulder-press rep counting: setup and re-rack movements are no longer miscounted.
- Reduce false reps triggered by stair climbing (AirPods).
- Improve live rep-count responsiveness on Apple Watch.
- Internal diagnostics hardening — no functional change.

### Fixed
- Restore AirPods deadlift detector parity.
## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Now ships the current SDK binary.** Earlier releases vendored stale, pre-rewrite
  XCFrameworks (old Core ML models + older detectors). This release re-vendors the
  current SDK build — no bundled ML models, and the current signal-based detectors
  (including the v53–v56 shoulder-press, stairs, parity and live-stream fixes).

### Added
- **Shoulder Press and Bicep Curl** (Apple Watch), matching the native SDK.
  `WorkoutType` now accepts `'squat' | 'deadlift' | 'benchpress' | 'shoulder_press' | 'bicep_curl'`.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Apple Watch rep detection for shoulder press, bicep curl, and deadlift.
- `WorkoutType` metadata: muscle groups, supported devices, and exercise-category filtering.
- On-watch set-review sheet (confirm, adjust reps, or discard a set) with an auto-skip timer.
- End-set-early during a workout, from the watch or the phone.
- Per-rep verdict callbacks (`onUserVerdictResolved`, `onAnyVerdictResolved`).
- Raw-set upload pipeline for feedback and rest analysis.

### Changed
- The watch returns to the clock face after a workout and wakes to the ready screen only on intent (open app, return from background, or edit the workout).
- Workout configuration is now a single versioned source delivered watch↔phone, removing config-sync races.
- The HealthKit session ends on workout completion so the watch app can background; no HealthKit session runs while idle (battery).

### Fixed
- Rep-count accuracy improvements across the watch detectors.
- Back-to-back workouts now start reliably (resolved a mirror-start stall).
- Correct set indexing when a new set or workout begins during the end-of-set window.

### Security
- Production builds strip symbol and reflection-metadata names; detection internals are no longer present as readable text in the shipped binary. No public API change.
## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Improve AirPods detector
- Improve Watch detector
## [2.1.3] - 2026-03-22

**Changed**
- Remove source `.mlmodel` files from the SDK bundle to prevent unnecessary Xcode recompilation in client projects
## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-22

**Breaking Changes**
- Rename SDK module from `SonarFit` to `SonarFitKit` — update all import statements

- Update logging API to support granular log levels — replace previous log configuration calls with the new `LogLevel` API

**Added**
- Add `WatchStatusManager` to monitor and respond to Apple Watch app state changes
- Add `resendWatchConfig` method to re-push configuration to the Watch when connectivity is lost
- Add communicating-state UI indicator when the SDK is syncing with the Watch
- Add Watch handshake to verify connection before workout operations
- Add device availability checks when starting or resuming a workout
- Add headphone status delegate to receive AirPods connectivity updates
- Add `skipRestWithCountdown` method as a timed variant of `skipRest`

**Changed**
- Update AirPods rep detector to v2 model with improved motion filtering for more accurate rep counts
- Replace AirPods workout detection with a new processing pipeline for lower latency and higher reliability
- Improve Watch connectivity handling and workout device session management
## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-22

**Breaking Changes**
- Rename SDK module from `SonarFit` to `SonarFitKit` — update all import statements
- Rename rep and set properties on workout models for clarity — update any property references at call sites
- Replace logging API with new granular log level system — update any custom logging configuration

**Added**
- New AirPods workout detection pipeline for rep counting via headphone motion sensors
- `WatchStatusManager` for observing Apple Watch app status
